  Overview
  ********

    The Autonomous Digital Adding Machine 1, or short ADAM/1, is an electronic
    digital computer based on 7400 series integrated circuits, with a word
    size of 16 bit (addresses and data).

    The CPU implements a microprogrammable CISC instruction set and does not
    differntiate between instruction and data memory (Von Neumann
    architecture).

    The initial design was sketched out on multiple napkins during a lunch
    break and is still awaiting completion. For now, the files in this
    directory contain a transcribed, sanitized version of the design.
