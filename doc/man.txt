  0) Data quantities

    The CPU itself has a 16 bit word size and cannot address smaller
    quanitites of bits. Nevertheless, an octet (8 bits) is refererred to
    as a byte and instructions exist that operate on bytes in a register.
    See the table below for naming conventions:

    Bits  Name
       1  bit
       2  tayste
       4  nybble
       8  byte, octet, half word
      16  chomp, word
      32  playte, double word
      64  dynner, quad


  1) CPU Registers

    The CPU has a total of 8 general purpose registers (R0...R7). The
    registers are treated equally and can be used by all instructions.

    The control logic uses R7 as program counter. This removes the need
    for special jump instructions and special program counter hardware,
    as a value can be simply written into R7 or added to R7.

    The machine also doesn't have a dedicated stack pointer and PUSH/POP
    instructions but instead provides indirect post-increment or pre-decrement
    addressing modes that can be used for building a stack with any register
    as stack pointer.

    However, the control logic uses the register R6 as kernel stack pointer
    when a trap or interrupt occoures or user mode wishes to transfer machine
    control to the kernel, so it might be desireable to use R6 as stack
    pointer in kernel mode code.


    In addition to the GP registers, the CPU has 1 status register, 3 control
    registers and 5 constants that are used by the control logic for special
    purposes.

    The constants are actually just control registers, totaling to 8 control
    registers that can be written in kernel mode and are read only in user
    mode.

    The constants have to be initialized propperly during machine bootstrap,
    as the control logic assumes them to have special values.


  1.1) Status Word

    The processor control logic has an internal status word register
    with the following contents:

        15 14 13 12 11 10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0
         *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  M  U  I  S  Z  C
        |_____________ _____________|  |  |  |  |  |  |
                      |                |  |  |  |  |  +-- carry
                      |                |  |  |  |  +----- zero
                      |                |  |  |  +-------- sign
                      |                |  |  +----------- interrupt enable
                      |                |  +-------------- user mode
                      |                +----------------- MMU enable
                      +---------------------------------- reserved

    The carry, zero and sign flags are altered by ALU instructions.

    If the interrupt enable flag is set, the CPU handles hardware
    interrupts, otherwise it ignores them.

    When the user mode flag is set, the program can no longer change
    control registers or flags other than S, Z, C.

    If the MMU enable flag is set, the memory management unit (if one is
    attached to the CPU) is active, otherwise there is no memory protection
    and memory access is mapped directly to physical adddresses.


    The status register cannot be accessed like the general purpose registers.
    Special instructions exists for transfering it back and forth between GP
    registers or memory. A special instruction exists for setting or clearing
    the C, Z, S and I flags.


    The remaining bits are reserved for future use. They cannot be written and
    reading them results in undefined values.

  1.2) Constants and Control Registers

    The CPU has a number of "constants" that are used by the control logic.
    The constants are actually just registers that are read only in user mode
    and can be written in kernel mode. Some (e.g. interrupt/trap handler
    address) can be freely configured, while others have to be initialized to
    specific values during bootstrap as the control logic assumes them to have
    specific values.

    Those freely configureable ones are referred to as "control registers",
    the others that need to have specific values are just called "constants".

    There are 5 constants and 3 control registers. The constants have to be
    initialized with the given values:

     Constant number | hex value or description
    -----------------+----------------------------------
                   0 | 0x0000
                   1 | 0x0001
                   2 | 0x0002
                   3 | 0xFF00
                   4 | 0x00FF
                   5 | syscall address
                   6 | interrupt/trap handler address
                   7 | kernel stack pointer backup

  1.3) Assembly names

    The following register names can be used in assembly code:

       Name | Description
      ------+----------------------------------------------------------------
        R0  | General purpose register 0
        R1  | General purpose register 1
        R2  | General purpose register 2
        R3  | General purpose register 3
        R4  | General purpose register 4
        R5  | General purpose register 5
        R6  | General purpose register 6
        R7  | General purpose register 7 (program counter)
            |
        C0  | Constant 0 (value 0x0000)
        C1  | Constant 1 (value 0x0001)
        C2  | Constant 2 (value 0x0002)
        CH  | Constant 3 (value 0xFF00, high byte mask)
        CL  | Constant 4 (value 0x00FF, low byte mask)
        CR0 | Control register 5 (syscall handler address)
        CR1 | Control register 6 (interrupt/trap handler address)
        CR2 | Control register 7 (kernel stack pointer backup)
            |
        SW  | Processor status word
            |
        PC  | Pseudo register, alias for R7
        SP  | Pseudo register, alias for R6

  2) Instruction Format

    All instructions are 16 bit in width and of the following format:

        15|14 13 12 11 10 9|8  7  6|5  4  3|2  1  0
         I|     OPCODE     |M  M  M|  dst  |  src
         |        |            |       |       |
         |        |            |       |       +------- Source register index
         |        |            |       |
         |        |            |       +--------------- Desination register or
         |        |            |                        flag index
         |        |            |
         |        |            +----------------------- Condition mode
         |        |
         |        +------------------------------------ Operation
         |
         +--------------------------------------------- Immediate flag

    Immediate flag:
      Set if an immediate value follows, cleared if the next word is an
      instruction.

    Condition mode:

        0    Always execute the instruction
        1    Skip instruction if carry flag is set
        2    Skip instruction if zero flag is set
        3    Skip instruction if sign flag is set
        4    Never execute the instruction
        5    Skip instruction if carry flag is NOT set
        6    Skip instruction if zero flag is NOT set
        7    Skip instruction if sign flag is NOT set


    In most cases, register indices 0 to 7 refere to GP resiters R0 to R7.
    When accessing the constant/control register module, the values are mapped
    to constants/control registers as in the table in section 1.2.

    If the destination index is used for addressing flag bits, the
    destionation values are interpreted as follows:

        0    clear carry
        1    clear zero
        2    clear sign
        3    clear interrupt enable
        4    set carry
        5    set zero
        6    set sign
        7    set interrupt enable



  3) CPU Instruction Set

    The assembler uses the prefix '@' to denote memory addresses. A
    prefixed '+' or '-' indicates that a register value is to be
    increment or decrement before using it's value to address memory,
    an appended '+' or '-' means that it should be incremented or
    decremented afterwards.

  4.1) Assember expressions

    In place of immediate values, the assembler supports simple arithmetic
    expressions that can be evaluated at translation time.

    The expression grammar is as follows (starting at ADDEXPR):

        ADDEXPR ::= MULEXPR ['+'|'-' ADDEXPR]
        MULEXPR ::= BITEXPR ['*'|'/' MULEXPR]
        BITEXPR ::= SHEXPR ['|'|'&'|'^' BITEXPR]
        SHEXPR ::= UNARY ['<<'|'>>' SHEXPR]

        UNARY ::= ['+'|'-'|'~'] PRIMEXPR
        PRIMEXPR ::= RECEXPR | NUMBER | NAMESTRING | '$$' | '$'
        RECEXPR ::= '(' ADDEXPR ')'


        NUMBER ::= HEXNUMBER | OCTNUMBER | DECNUMBER | BINNUMBER

        HEXNUMBER ::= '0x' [0-9a-fA-F]+
        OCTNUMBER ::= '0' [0-7]*
        DECNUMBER ::= [1-9] [0-9]*
        BINNUMBER ::= '0b' ('0'|'1')+

        NAMESTRING ::= [a-zA-Z_.] [a-zA-Z0-9_@.]*

    The element DECNUMBER represents a numeric constant in decimal notation,
    OCTNUMBER in octal notation, HEXNUMBER in hexadecimal notation and
    BINNUMBER in binary notation.

    The element NAMESTRING represents the name of a label or constant defined
    with the ".equ" directive or a sub expression defined with ".def".

    The special constant '$$' resolves to the absolute address of the next
    instruction and '$' resolves to the absolute address of the current
    instruction.

  4.2) Labels and symbols

    The assembler requires all labels that are not defined within an assembly
    file to be appear in an import (.imp) pseudo instruction. If the target
    format has symbol tables, the assembler writes the imported labels and the
    locations where the addresses are required into the symbol table.

    If labels are exported (.exp pseudo instruction) and the target format has
    a symbol tables, the labels and their addresses are written to that symbol
    table.

  4.3) Octet strings

    The ASCII (American Standards Code for Information Interchange) specifies
    a portable way of encoding a wide range of characters in 7 bit numbers.

    On computer systems where the word size is a multiple of 8, ASCII
    characters are typically stored as 8 bit quantities. The additional
    bit is often used to extend the character set with additional,
    proprietary character codes. In addition, a standard (UTF-8) has
    been developed that takes advantage of the additional bit to store
    unicode characters in a variable size encoding, while staying backwards
    compatbile to ASCII.

    The assembler supports the directive ".asc" to dump a string of 8 bit
    characters (encoding doesn't matter, typically ASCII, could also be
    UTF-8 or codepage-random, whatever octet string it "sees" in its input).

    Since the machine can only address 16 bit quantities, there are two
    possible ways to squeeze an octet stream into 16 bit memory slots:

     - The first character is stored in the lower half, the next character in
       the upper half.
     - The first character is stored in the upper half, the next character in
       the lower half.


    The first option is chosen by ".asc lh", the second option by ".asc hl".

    The result of the two options for the string "Hello World\0" is outline
    below, the rows repsent memory addresses, the column labeld "HI" the
    higher half of the word, the column "LO" the lower half

                                 |
        .asc lh "Hello World\0"  | .asc hl "Hello World\0"
                                 |
           HI  LO                |    HI   LO
        0  H   e                 | 0  e    H
        1  l   l                 | 1  l    l
        2  o  ' '                | 2  ' '  o
        3  W   o                 | 3  o    W
        4  r   l                 | 4  l    r
        5  d  '\0'               | 5  \0'  d



    As you might have noticed, the assembler supports C-style escape
    sequences in the specification of strings. The following escape
    sequences are supported:

      \a            0x07 (alarm bell)
      \b            0x08 (backspacce)
      \f            0x0C (form feed)
      \n            0x0A (line feed)
      \r            0x0D (cariage return)
      \t            0x09 (horizontal tab)
      \v            0x0B (vertical tab)
      \\            0x5C (backslash)
      \"            0x22 (double quotation mark)
      \OCTNUMBER         any arbitrary character code


    If the number of characters in the string is odd, the string is padded
    with a 0 value (character code 0) at the end.


  4.4) UTF-16 strings

    UTF-16 is standard means for encoding unicode characters in 16 bit
    words (1 word for the base plane, max. 2 words for everything else)
    and is a comparatively much simpler and straight forward way of
    encoding characters for a machine with 16 bit word size.

    The assembler supports dumping UTF-16 strings to the output by using the
    directive ".utf". The string that follows is assumed to be encoded in the
    same character set as the rest of the input file and converted to UTF-16
    if neccessary.

    In addtion to the escape sequences specified in the section above, the
    .utf directive also supports the sequence "\U+XXXXX" to specify an
    arbitrary unicode code point.


  5) Interrupts and Traps

    When a hardware interrupt or a processor trap (e.g. illegal op-code) is
    triggered, the CPU effectively performs the following operations:

        If user mode flag is set:
            1. temp := CR2
            2. *(temp--) := R6
            3. *(temp--) := R7
            4. *(temp--) := SW
            5. *(temp--) := <trap number>
            6. R6 := temp
            7. R7 := CR1
            8. clear user mode and interrupt enable flags
        otherwise:
            1. *(R6--) := R6
            2. *(R6--) := R7
            3. *(R6--) := SW
            4. *(R6--) := <trap number>
            4. R7 := CR1
            5. clear interrupt enable flags


    The following trap numbers are generated by the CPU:
        0   A hardware interrupt occoured
        1   Illegal OP-Code encountered
        2   MMU Page fault



    A handler routine can return from an interrupt or trap by using the
    TMC instruction after removing the trap number from the stack.

    In case of a trap, execution of the current instruction is aborted.
    Returning from the trap hadler causes the same instruction to be
    executed again.

    In case of a hardware interrupt, execution of the current instruction
    is completed before jumping into the handler routine. Returning from
    the interrupt handler causes the next instruction to be executed.
