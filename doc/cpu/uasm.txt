  Micro Assembler
  ***************

 A single source line in the micro assembly specifies the state of the control
 lines during a clock cycle.

 A line consists of a pipe seperated sequence of keywords in the shape of:

    <RDMOD>|<SRC>|<DST>|<FLAGS>

 An arbitrary number of space charactes can be inserted between keywords.



 RDMOD specifies a module to switch onto the bus and may consist of one of
 the following keywords:
      CWD   - constant and control register module (00x)
      ADD   - adder module (010)
      AND   - and logic module (011)
      ORV   - or logic module (012)
      XOR   - xor logic module (013)
      BSW   - byte swapped B (014)
      BOP   - B operand (015)
      SHV   - right shift/rotated B operand register (016)
      AOP   - A operand (017)
      REG   - GP regster (02x)
      PSW   - status word (030)
      MEM   - memory read (037)
      *     - hold the state of the previous line

 The values for SRC and DST specify the lower 3 bit of "src" and "dst" on
 the control bus respecitively.

 They can either be numeric values in the range 0 to 7, the letter 'S'
 specifes the source index from the current instruction word, the letter 'D'
 specifies the destination index. The character '*' specifies that the
 previous state should be held.

 SRC and DST cannot be both 'D' or 'S'.

 If RDMOD is not REG or CWD, SRC has no meaning and must be '-'.


 The <FLAGS> field is itself a pipe ('|') seperated list of one or more of
 the following keywords:

    MEMW    - write bus word to memory location in A operand
    AINV    - invert adder B operand when latching
    REGW    - write bus word to register
    BWR     - write bus word to B operand
    AWR     - write bus word to A operand
    WC      - write bus word to control register

    TPW     - toggle psw value (depending on DST)
    CLU     - clear user bit
    UOV     - override user flag (temporarily force to 0)
    CINH    - inhibit carry (temporarily force to 0)
    COV     - override carry (temporarily force to 1)
    UCF     - update carry flag
    ULF     - update logic flags
    WSW     - write bus word to status word.
              In user mode, only ALU flas are written.

    FIN     - fetch next instruction after this line


 In addition to such bus state lines, a line can also contain meta directive
 for the micro assembler. Those directives start with a '%' sign.

 The following directives are currently supported:


    %opdef <opcode>

        Start defining the instruction sequence for an opcode. The opcode
        number is specified as a 3 digit octal number (1st value is immediate
        flag).

    %include <filename>

        Process the contents of the given file and treat it, as if they
        were listed instead of the directive.

    %if <user>

        Execute the following statements if:
         - the user mode flag is set
         - a pagefault is asserted and the MMU enable flag is set

    %else

        Execute the following statements if the condition of the previous
        "%if" does not hold.

    %endif

        Termianate an %if/%else conditional block and execute the following
        statements independend of that condition.
