 OMNIBUS
 *******

  The CPU has been redesigned to use a single 64 pin DIN41612 backplane bus.
  The previous prototype used a split control & data bus with one ribbon cable
  each and had the CPU split into a high-half and a low-half, connected by a
  single module that attached to all four cables (it was cheap but turned out
  quite messy).

  The unified bus "OMNIBUS" contains data & address lines, control lines
  and supply voltage. The pinout is as follows:

           65   1
        VCC o   o VCC
         D0 o   o
         D1 o   o

 1) Address line

  There are 8 address lines on the bus, 5 source select lines (A0...A4) and
  3 destination select lines (B0...B2).

  The source address determines what module output to write onto the bus:

        000   constant 0
        001   constant 1
        002   constant 2
        003   constant 3
        004   constant 4
        005   control register 0
        006   control register 1
        007   control register 2
        010   adder output
        011   logic board output 0
        012   logic board output 1
        013   logic board output 2
        014   operand B, byte swapped
        015   operand B
        016   operand B, rotated right through carry
        017   operand A
        020   GP register 0
        021   GP register 1
        022   GP register 2
        023   GP register 3
        024   GP register 4
        025   GP register 5
        026   GP register 6
        027   GP register 7
        030   status word
        031   --unassigned--
        032   --unassigned--
        033   --unassigned--
        034   --unassigned--
        035   --unassigned--
        036   --unassigned--
        037   memory read


  The destination address is used by the register and control register module
  as destination register address and by the status word module for
  addressing bits.


 2) Control lines driven by the control logic

  The following control lines are driven directly by the CPU control logic
  or one of the front panel switches:

    MEMW  - Pulled low to write to the memory bus, connected to the
            external bus
    AINV  - Pulled high to invert the second adder operand of the adder
    REGW  - Pulled high to write to a GP register. Falling edge actually
            triggers the latches.
    BWR   - Pulled low to write to the B operand. Rising edge actualy triggers
            the latches.
    AWR   - Pulled low to write to the A operand. Rising edge actualy triggers
            the latches.
    WC    - Pulled high to write to a control register. Falling edge actually
            triggers the latches.

    UCF   - Rising edge triggers overwrite of carry flag

    ULF   - Rising edge triggers overwrite of zero & sign flags

    PSWR  - Rising edge triggers overwrite of all status flags. If user mode
            flag is set, only carry, zero & sign are overwritten.

    PSEL  - Select what to write into carry, zero & sing flag if write is
            triggered. Pulled low to write the lower 3 bits of the bus word,
            high to write the new values from the ALU modules.

    CLU   - Pulled low to clear the user mode flag.

    UOV   - Pulled low to temporarily force the user mode flag to zero.

    CINH  - Pulled low to temporarily force the carry flag to zero.

    COV   - Pulled high to temporarily force the carry flag to one.

    TPW   - Pulled low to toggle bits in status word. B1 & B0 select the bit
            to toggle (0=carry, 1=zero, 2=sign, 3=interrupt enable) and B2
            selects the value to set it to. The interrupt enable value cannot
            be changed if the user mode flag is set.

    MMUOV - Pulled low to temporarily bypass an external memory management
            unit, i.e. force the I/O bus MMU enable line to 0.

    M1    - Connected directly to the external I/O bus. Pulled low by the
            control logic if the a memory read is actually an instruction
            fetch.

 3) Status bits

    CIN  - Current carry from status word, used by adder and shift modules

    COUT - Carry output of the adder module

    SOUT - LSB shifted out by shift module if shift module is latched onto
           bus, same as COUT if output is disabled.

    MMU  - MMU enable flag from status word

    USR  - User mode flag from status word

    PF   - Pulled low by peripheral logic to trigger a pagefault

    INT  - Pulled low by peripheral logic to trigger a hardware interrupt

    SIGN - The current value of the sign flag

    IEN  - The current value of the interrupt enable flag

    ZERO - The current value of the zero flag

    NZERO- Pulled low if the current bus word is zero

    MMU  - The current value of the MMU enable flag

    USR  - The current value of the user mode flag
